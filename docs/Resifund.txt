Small projects don’t attract investors
Climate adaptation is underfunded
Low trust in transparency and ESG accountability
Lack of accessible, climate resilient infrastructure
Problems

Invest in Resilience-Own the Future.
Global Climate Statistics
Funding Exclusion: The Market Gap
$1.3T in climate finance (OECD, 2023), but <10% reaches local adaptation
Only 3.5% supports the urban poor
(World Bank, 2023)
Top-Down Solutions: The Structural Gap
Existing tools are slow, centralized, and rigid
Communities can’t access or guide infrastructure funding
Community Disempowerment: The Social Gap
70% of city projects lack local participation
(World Bank, 2023)
Solutions often fail due to low trust and poor fit
